## Tips & Best Practices

### Dynamic vs Static Groups

**Dynamic Groups:**
- Members calculated automatically based on criteria
- Use for department-based, location-based access
- Updates automatically when user attributes change

**Static Groups:**
- Members added manually
- Use for special access, temporary permissions
- Requires manual updates

### People Pool Criteria

Common categories to use:
- `department` - Engineering, HR, Sales, etc.
- `location` - New York, London, Berlin, etc.
- `country` - USA, UK, Germany, etc.
- `jobTitle` - Manager, Developer, etc.
- `userType` - Employee, Contractor, etc.

### Search Tips

- Search is case-insensitive
- Searches in group names, user names, emails
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Filter by specific fields via API

---

## Troubleshooting

### Can't see any data?
Run the seed script:
```cmd
cd backend
npm run seed
```

### Changes not showing?
Refresh the page or check browser console for errors

### API returns empty array?
Check that backend is running and MongoDB is connected

### Permission group has no members?
- Check include/exclude criteria
- Verify users match the criteria
- For Dynamic groups, members calculate automatically
